# 💫 About Me:



Hi, I'm JdM, also known as Judemont.

I'm still at school, but in my spare time I like to code useful and not-so-useful projects.

For me, IT, development and the Internet are a world of innovation limited only by the imagination of motivated people.

I'm trying through my projects and my usages to promote a more free, open and fun internet. 


I'm from switzerland 🇨🇭, I speak French and some English.
