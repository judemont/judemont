# 💫 About Me:



Hi, I'm JdM, also known as Judemont.
I'm an IT student and in my free time, I enjoy coding useful and not-so-useful projects.

For me, IT, development and the Internet are a world of innovation limited only by the imagination of motivated people.

I'm trying through my projects and my usages to promote a more *free*, *open* and *fun* internet. 


I'm from switzerland 🇨🇭, I speak French and some English.
